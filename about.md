As design and development is constantly evolving, I am constantly seeking knowledge - keeping abreast with advances in technology, industry standards and practices, learning new software and techniques.

I have worked with companies and brands all over the world (US, Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Caribbean): Curacao Marriott Beach Resort and Emerald Casino, Kobojo, Informatics Institute, Business Security Systems, Rockpoint Hotel and Conference Center, D.M. Consunji and more!
