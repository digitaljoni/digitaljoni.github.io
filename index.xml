Flutter SDK allows you to build an app using a single codebase that can be compiled to both Android and IOS. It is also used to build applications for Google Fuchsia OS.
You write your Flutter applications using a programming language called Dart. Unlike other solutions which uses a bridge, your Dart code gets compiled to machine code. This gives you the advantage of having native performance for your app.</description></item><item><title>PhStocks Tracker</title><link>https://digitaljoni.com/projects/phstocks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://digitaljoni.com/projects/phstocks/</guid><description>PhStocks Tracker is a mobile app that Philippine stock investors can utilize to watch price changes to their selected stocks.

You would need to create SVG vectors for your icon images. You can use Adobe Illustrator or Sketch to create vector files.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://digitaljoni.com/privacy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2018 00:35:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://digitaljoni.com/privacy/</guid><description>Embedded content from other websites Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.).
