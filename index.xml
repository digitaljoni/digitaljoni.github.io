Flutter SDK allows you to build an app using a single codebase that can be compiled to both Android and IOS. It is also used to build applications for Google Fuchsia OS.
You write your Flutter applications using a programming language called Dart. Unlike other solutions which uses a bridge, your Dart code gets compiled to machine code. This gives you the advantage of having native performance for your app.</description></item><item><title>PhStocks Tracker</title><link>https://digitaljoni.com/projects/phstocks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://digitaljoni.com/projects/phstocks/</guid><description>PhStocks Tracker is a mobile app that Philippine stock investors can utilize to watch price changes to their selected stocks. This app is primarily focused on users who use Fundamental Analysis as their investment strategy.
Why I Built The App If you are a busy person (i.e. a full-time employee or a student), you wouldn't have the time to go your stock broker's site daily to check the latest changes to your stocks.</description></item><item><title>Dart Resources</title><link>https://digitaljoni.com/resources/dart/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://digitaljoni.com/resources/dart/</guid><description>Dart is the programming language used on both Flutter and AngularDart. Developed by Google, it aims to enable developers to build complex and high-performing apps. One advantage of using Dart is that you can build your business logic once and use it on both mobile (Flutter) and web (AngularDart) applications. You can even use Dart server-side as well.

Let’s say you have config_dev.dart currently containing settings of your app in a development environment:
const String apiUrl = “localhost:3000/api/articles/“ const bool debugMode = false; Now, for example, you would need to change the URL of the API to point to another local machine or test server within your network.</description></item><item><title>OOP in Dart - DBZ Edition</title><link>https://digitaljoni.com/blog/oop-in-dart-dbz-edition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://digitaljoni.com/blog/oop-in-dart-dbz-edition/</guid><description>The following slideshow was part of my talk last February 2020 which gives a fun look at object-oriented programming in Dart. I used familiar anime characters to make it easy enough for beginners to understand and to be clear enough to illustrate objects in Dart language.

It is a good start for most as it teaches us the basics of how a simple program would work. The text or greeting that we use is also somewhat significant as if our tiny creation is greeting the world and at the same time announcing, hey I am the start of a wonderful adventure for my creator, that there is potential for greatness if this action is continued and improved upon.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://digitaljoni.com/privacy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2018 00:35:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://digitaljoni.com/privacy/</guid><description>Embedded content from other websites Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.).

In this project it would be a bit different though. Basically most decisions on how the artwork is rendereed are left to the program itself.
It uses the built-in function &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; to make the decisions it uses a &amp;ldquo;seed&amp;rdquo; value of the current timestamp. Based on the results, the program goes through a decision tree to determine various aspects of the art: canvas color, color theme, what to draw, will there be a foreground, midground and background, and more!</description></item></channel></rss>
